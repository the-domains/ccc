At Safety Net, we provide products that promote safety and health to  consumers and health care professionals. Safety Net helps to achieve  safer care environments for patients and residents in hospitals, long term  care and the community settings, specifically in regards to infection  control and prevention.  Infection Control & Prevention Infection control and prevention has never been more important than it is today. The spreading of germs that cause illness is a concern for everyone. The workplace...the gym...the classroom...in the hospital... Regardless of how and where germs are transmitted, the potential risk of being exposed surrounds us everyday. Traditional cleaning methods, such as a rag and bleach, are not enough.  These are most often used incorrectly and just spread the germs around. Treat every room in your facility  with a system proven to kill disease-causing pathogens, including the difficult to kill, C. diff spores. Introducing the Halo Disinfection System from Sanosil International. The Halo Disinfection System combines a choice of two patented 5% hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectants for use with the dry-mist dispensing HaloFogger(tm) as an easy-to-use, and affordable surface disinfection system. Unlike the ineffective "spray & wipe" approach and disinfecting technologies like UV, the Halo Disinfection System delivers hands-free, whole room surface disinfection at a 6-log kill rate that saves patients' lives.   At the push of a button, the Halo dispenses a dry mist of atomized Halo(tm) Disinfectant into the air. The droplets fill the room and are drawn into every nook, crevice and corner, reaching surfaces that regular cleaning and disinfecting can't. The Halo assures a homogenous distribution of disinfectant on all surfaces in the room, reducing the risk of cross-contamination of infectious diseases associated with using a rag, wipe or sponge.
